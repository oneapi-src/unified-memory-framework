Pools
==========================================

The UMF memory pool is a combination of a pool allocator and a memory provider. 
The pool allocator controls the memory pool and handles fine-grained memory 
allocations memory allocations.

UMF includes predefined pool allocators. UMF can also work with user-defined 
pools which implement the memory pool API.

Memory Pool
------------------------------------------

The memory pool API provides a malloc-like API for allocating and deallocating 
memory as well as functions that create, destroy and operate on the pool.

.. doxygenfile:: memory_pool.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var
    
Disjoint Pool
------------------------------------------

The Disjoint Pool allocates user data using the configured provider, while also 
preserving metadata in DRAM.

.. doxygenfile:: pool_disjoint.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Jemalloc Pool
------------------------------------------

A jemalloc-based memory pool manager. More info about jemalloc could be found
here: https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc.

.. doxygenfile:: pool_jemalloc.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Proxy Pool
------------------------------------------

Proxy Pool forwards all requests to the underlying memory provider. Currently 
umfPoolRealloc, umfPoolCalloc and umfPoolMallocUsableSize functions are not 
supported by the Proxy Pool.

.. doxygenfile:: pool_proxy.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Scalable Pool
------------------------------------------
.. doxygenfile:: pool_scalable.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Providers
==========================================

The memory provider is responsible for coarse-grained memory allocations and 
memory page management. 

UMF includes predefined providers, but can also work with providers which 
implement the memory provider API.

Memory Provider
------------------------------------------

The memory provider API provides a functions for allocating, deallocating and 
manipulating coarse-grained memory as well as functions that create, destroy 
and operate on the provider.

.. doxygenfile:: memory_provider.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Coarse Provider
------------------------------------------

A memory provider that should be used as a "cache" for pre-allocated buffer or 
with additional upstream provider (e.g. OS Memory Provider).

.. doxygenfile:: provider_coarse.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

OS Memory Provider
------------------------------------------

A memory provider that provides memory from an operating system.

.. doxygenfile:: provider_os_memory.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Level Zero Provider
------------------------------------------

A memory provider that provides memory from L0 device.

.. doxygenfile:: provider_level_zero.h
    :sections: define enum typedef func var

Memspace
==========================================

TODO: Add general information about memspaces.

Memspace
------------------------------------------
.. doxygenfile:: memspace.h
