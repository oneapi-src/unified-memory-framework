	* Version 1.0.0

	The Unified Memory Framework (UMF) is a library for constructing allocators and memory pools.
	It also contains broadly useful abstractions and utilities for memory management.
	UMF allows users to manage multiple memory pools characterized by different attributes,
	allowing certain allocation types to be isolated from others and allocated using different
	hardware resources as required.

	While this is the first UMF release with the backward compatibility guarantee,
	part of the library's API (at the moment: CTL, memspace, memtarget, and mempolicy)
	is still experimental and may change in future releases.

	Due to cleanup and improvements there have been some API changes made:
	- add const qualifier to parameters, where applicable (#1257, #1266)
	- unify return values (#1387, #1370)
	- make pool get name an obligatory pool function (#1398)
	- make out parameters the last functions' arguments (#1408)

	This release contains also:
	- new experimental CTL API (i.a. #913, #1073, #1206)
	- add umfPoolGetName (#1320)
	- use multiple arenas in Jemalloc pool (#1214)
	- make umfInit thread-safe (#1399)
	- add umfd debug library on Windows (#1219, #1238)
	- deprecate UMF_DISABLE_HWLOC CMake build option (#1308)
	- fix: numanode index retrieval (#1309)
	- fix: reset base allocator destroy flag (#1326)

	* Version 0.10.1

	This patch release contains:
	- Set symbol versions 0.10 in def/map files (#1013)
	- Fix: remove incorrect assert in utils_align_ptr_up_size_down() (#977)
	- Add strings with UMF version and useful CMake options (#992)
	- Extended error messages, when providers are disabled (#1012)

Mon Dec 09 2024 Łukasz Stolarczuk <lukasz.stolarczuk@intel.com>

	* Version 0.10.0

	In this release we introduced updates in several areas, listed below.
	We still don't yet guarantee a fully stable API, though.
	With new parameters' API we broke the compatibility, as we no longer
	support direct access to UMF params via (now internal) structures.

	Significant updates:
	- updated Level Zero Provider
	- new API to handle UMF parameters (replacing previous struct's)
	- extended IPC API testing
	- new Memtarget and Memspace API

	Minor updates:
	- multiple fixes in the source code
	- extended code coverage reporting
	- improved CI and testing
	- new examples
	- extended logging
	- yet more fixes in the building system

Tue Nov 12 2024 Łukasz Stolarczuk <lukasz.stolarczuk@intel.com>

	* Version 0.9.1

	This patch release contains only 3 small fixes in build system of UMF.

Thu Sep 12 2024 Łukasz Stolarczuk <lukasz.stolarczuk@intel.com>

	* Version 0.9.0

	This release aims to be the first complete release of the UMF project.
	We don't yet guarantee a fully stable API, though.

	This release contains all the features listed in the version 0.1.0
	plus, additionally:
	- IPC API
	- fixes in the building system
	- proper versioning
	- minor patches in the source code
	- improved CI and docs

Thu Jul 04 2024 Łukasz Stolarczuk <lukasz.stolarczuk@intel.com>

	* Version 0.1.0

	This is the first release of Unified Memory Framework (UMF) project.

	UMF is a library for constructing allocators and memory pools. It also contains
	broadly useful abstractions and utilities for memory management. UMF allows
	users to create and manage multiple memory pools characterized by different
	attributes, allowing certain allocation types to be isolated from others and
	allocated using different hardware resources as required.

	Documentation of UMF, including API description, architecture, and examples
	can be found: https://oneapi-src.github.io/unified-memory-framework

	Features:
	- Level Zero memory provider
	- OS memory provider
	- Jemalloc pool (based on jemalloc)
	- Scalable pool (based on oneTBB)
	- Disjoint pool
	- Proxy pool
	- Single-threaded micro benchmark based on ubench and custom multi-threaded benchmark
	- Examples
