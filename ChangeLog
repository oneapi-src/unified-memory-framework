	* Version 0.10.0

	In this release we introduced updates in several areas, listed below.
	We still don't yet guarantee a fully stable API, though.
	With new parameters' API we broke the compatibility, as we no longer
	support direct access to UMF params via (now internal) structures.

	Significant updates:
	- updated Level Zero Provider
	- new API to handle UMF parameters (replacing previous struct's)
	- extended IPC API testing
	- new Memtarget and Memspace API

	Minor updates:
	- multiple fixes in the source code
	- extended code coverage reporting
	- improved CI and testing
	- new examples
	- extended logging
	- yet more fixes in the building system

	* Version 0.1.0

	This is the first release of Unified Memory Framework (UMF) project.

	UMF is a library for constructing allocators and memory pools. It also contains
	broadly useful abstractions and utilities for memory management. UMF allows
	users to create and manage multiple memory pools characterized by different
	attributes, allowing certain allocation types to be isolated from others and
	allocated using different hardware resources as required.

	Documentation of UMF, including API description, architecture, and examples
	can be found: https://oneapi-src.github.io/unified-memory-framework

	Features:
	- Level Zero memory provider
	- OS memory provider
	- Jemalloc pool (based on jemalloc)
	- Scalable pool (based on oneTBB)
	- Disjoint pool
	- Proxy pool
	- Single-threaded micro benchmark based on ubench and custom multi-threaded benchmark
	- Examples
