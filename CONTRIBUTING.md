Below you'll find instructions on how to contribute to UMF, either with code changes
or issues. All contributions are most welcome!

## Opening new issues

Please log bugs or suggestions as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/oneapi-src/unified-memory-framework/issues).

When reporting a bug remember about the details, at least:
- version of UMF (hash of a commit or a tag),
- OS and kernel,
- compiler.

When opening a new issue you can pick a predefined type of issue. Please follow
the template and fill in all the information. If your query doesn't match any of
the proposed types, just pick a general issue with no template.

## Submitting Pull Requests

We take all code contributions to UMF through GitHub Pull Requests.
You must first create your own fork of the project and submit your changes to a branch.
You can then raise a Pull Request targeting `oneapi-src/unified-memory-framework:main`.

When opening a new Pull Request, you'll be provided with a simple template
to follow with the basic requirements for your changes to fulfill.

A good practices, when opening a PR, are:
 - one PR should fix/enhance one thing, split large PR into a few smaller PRs,
 - keep commits neat and in order,
 - squash commits to include only relevant ones (no "fixes after review" or similar),
 - if a commit fixes an open issue, add in the commit message line: `Fixes #<issue_no>`,
 - if a commit only mention an open issue, add in the commit message, e.g. `Ref. #<issue_no>`.

### Building and testing

Building commands can be found in the top-level Readme file - section
["Build"](./README.md#build).

Before committing you should test locally if all tests and checks pass.
When project is built, enter the build directory and execute:

```bash
$ ctest --output-on-failure
```

Any test's failure will produce error log.

To enable additional checks (including `-Werror` / `/WX` compilation flag), switch on CMake flag
`UMF_DEVELOPER_MODE`. To read more about all available CMake options please see
["CMake standard options"](./README.md#cmake-standard-options) section in the top-level Readme.

### Code style
We use `clang-format` to verify and apply code style changes to C/C++ source files.
To see all rules we require, please take a look at `.clang-format` file in the 
root directory of this repository. Similarly, we use `cmake-format` tool and
`.cmake-format` file to verify and apply code style changes to CMake files.
For Python source files we use `black` tool.

To enable code style checks and re-formatting, CMake option `UMF_FORMAT_CODE_STYLE` has to
be switched on. You'll then have additional CMake targets available.

To verify correct coding style of your changes execute (assuming `build` is your build directory):

```bash
$ cmake -B build -DUMF_FORMAT_CODE_STYLE=ON
$ cmake --build build --target format-check
```

We run these checks in our Continuous Integration (CI). So, if any issues were found,
the Pull Request will be blocked from merging. To apply proper formatting (meaning,
to fix the issues) you can use the convenience target provided for applying formats:

```bash
$ cmake --build build --target format-apply

# Remember to review introduced changes
```

**NOTE**: The `format-check` and `format-apply` targets are only available if all of `clang-format`,
`cmake-format` and `black` are installed. Otherwise you can use them separately with:
- `clang-format-check` and `clang-format-apply` for C/C++ source files 
- `cmake-format-check` and `cmake-format-apply` for CMake files
- `black-format-check` and `black-format-apply` for Python source files

**NOTE**: We use specific versions of formatting tools to ensure consistency across the project. The required versions are:
- clang-format version **15.0**, which can be installed with the command: `python -m pip install clang-format==15.0.7`.
- cmake-format version **0.6**, which can be installed with the command: `python -m pip install cmake-format==0.6.13`.
- black (no specific version required), which can be installed with the command: `python -m pip install black`.

Please ensure you have these specific versions installed before contributing to the project.

### When my PR is merged?

Your Pull Request (PR) will be merged if you meet several requirements - the basic are:
- The project builds properly,
- All tests are executed, and no issues have been reported,
- All checks pass (code style, spelling, etc.),
- Additional requirements are fulfilled (e.g., see below, for a new public API function).

While the most of these requirements are verified via automated scripts run in
Continuous Integration (CI) they are also verified with human touch - **the review**!

Code review has to be done by at least two UMF maintainers. The "maintainers team"
is added to each PR by default, but you can also pick specific people to review
your code. It may speed up a little the review process. If any issues are found by
reviewers they should be fixed by the owner of the PR.

Now, when all GitHub Actions jobs are green, all review discussions are resolved, and
you got two approvals from reviewers - you're good to go - your PR will be merged soon!

### Extending public API

When adding a new public function, you have to make sure to update:
- documentation,
- map files with debug symbols (both .def and .map - for Windows and Linux),
- appropriate examples (to show usage),
- tests.

### Naming convention
TODO: add this section and re-format whole codebase to use such convention

### License

Unified Memory Framework is licensed under the terms in [LICENSE](./LICENSE.TXT) file. By contributing to the project,
you agree to the license and copyright terms therein and release your contribution under these terms.

**NOTE:**
>Each new file added to the repository has to contain the appropriate license header. To see what
>such a header looks like, you can see an existing file, at best, with the same file extension
>(each type of file may have slightly different formatting and/or comment convention).

With your contributions to this repository you also certify the following:

    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

```

In case of any doubt, the maintainer may ask you to certify the above in writing, i.e.
via email or by including a `Signed-off-by:` line at the bottom of your commit message.

Please, use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.), e.g.:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

### Adding new dependency

Adding each new dependency (including new docker image or a package) should be done in
a separate commit. The commit message should be:

```
New dependency: dependency_name

license: SPDX license tag
origin: https://dependency_origin.com
```

## Code coverage

After adding a new functionality add tests and check coverage before and after the change.
To do this, enable coverage instrumentation by turning on the UMF_USE_COVERAGE flag in CMake.
Coverage instrumentation feature is supported only by GCC and Clang.
An example flow might look like the following:

```bash
$ cmake -B build -DUMF_USE_COVERAGE=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
$ cmake --build build -j
$ cd build
$ ctest
$ apt install lcov
$ lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
$ genhtml -o html_report coverage.info
```

## Debugging

### Checking the UMF version and CMake variables (Linux only)

Strings with the UMF version and useful CMake variables can be grepped in the following way:

```bash
$ strings libumf.so | grep "@(#)"
@(#) Intel(R) UMF version: 0.11.0-dev.git66.g89e3831d
@(#) Intel(R) UMF CMake variables: "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:Debug,...
```

#### Requirements

- binutils package (Linux)
